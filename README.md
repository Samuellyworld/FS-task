# FS-task

I Installed package node-fetch since fetch doesn't come with nodejs.

The API data is gotten from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

I checked in the variable filePath in script.js if there is a folder called 'result' with a ternary operator.

The posts.json is found in result folder directory as written in the instruction.
